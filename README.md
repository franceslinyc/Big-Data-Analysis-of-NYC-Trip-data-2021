Big Data Analysis of NYC TLC Trip Record (Yellow, Green Taxi, For-Hire Vehicle, HFHV) Data

Frances Lin

Description: 




Documentation:

[Lin_CS512_Final_Project.pdf](https://github.com/franceslinyc/Big-Data-Analysis-of-NYC-Trip-data-2021/blob/main/analysis/Lin_CS512_Final_Project.pdf) contains the full report

Lin_Plotting contains codes that join datasets and produce plots

Instruction: 

A major portion of this project was done using **Google Cloud** servies (e.g. **Storage**, **Dataprep**, **BigQuery**, **Dataprep** for **PySpark**) so the results are less likely reproducible. However, for reporting and plotting 

1. Move everything to the main folder 
2. Run Lin_CS512_Final_Project.Rmd to generate report
3. Run Lin_Plotting.Rmd to join datasets and produce plots
