# Big-Data-Analysis-of-NYC-Trip-data-2021
Final project for CS512 Data Science Tools and Programming (Big Data) at OSU

Big Data Analysis of NYC TLC Trip Record (Yellow, Green Taxi, For-Hire Vehicle, HFHV) Data

Frances Lin

Description: We use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services (e.g. Compute Engine, BigQuery, Cloud Dataproc) and PySpark/Apache Spark to explore and analyze the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission's trip records of 2019-2020 (~ 35.26 GB).

Documentation:

[Lin_CS512_Final_Project.pdf](https://github.com/franceslinyc/Big-Data-Analysis-of-NYC-Trip-data-2021/blob/main/analysis/Lin_CS512_Final_Project.pdf) contains the full report

Lin_Plotting contains codes that join datasets and produce plots

Instruction: 

A major portion of this project was done using **Google Cloud** services (e.g. **Storage**, **Dataprep**, **BigQuery**, **Dataprep** for **PySpark**) so the results are less likely reproducible. However, for reporting and plotting 

1. Move every file to the main folder 
2. Run Lin_CS512_Final_Project.Rmd to generate report
3. Run Lin_Plotting.Rmd to join datasets and produce plots
