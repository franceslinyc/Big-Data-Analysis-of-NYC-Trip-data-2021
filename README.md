Final project for CS512 Data Science Tools and Programming (Big Data) at OSU

Big Data Analysis of NYC TLC Trip Record (Yellow, Green Taxi, For-Hire Vehicle, HFHV) Data

Frances Lin

Description: We use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services (e.g. Compute Engine, BigQuery, Cloud Dataproc) and PySpark/Apache Spark to explore and analyze the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission's trip records of 2019-2020 (~ 35.26 GB).

Documentation:

[Lin_CS512_Final_Project.pdf](https://github.com/franceslinyc/Big-Data-Analysis-of-NYC-Trip-data-2021/blob/main/analysis/Lin_CS512_Final_Project.pdf) contains the full report

Lin_Plotting contains codes that join datasets and produce plots


Note: A major portion of this project was done using Google Cloud services (e.g. Compute Engine, Dataflow, BigQuery, Dataprep for PySpark) so the results are less likely reproducible. However, for reporting and plotting 

1. Move every file to the main folder 
2. Run Lin_CS512_Final_Project.Rmd to generate report
3. Run Lin_Plotting.Rmd to join datasets and produce plots
